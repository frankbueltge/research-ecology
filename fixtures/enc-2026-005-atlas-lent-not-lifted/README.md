# enc-2026-005-atlas-lent-not-lifted — README

**Status: `approval: draft`** (same-day transcription, 2026-07-21; wording not yet read by
Frank). Nine events (as of 2026-07-22, incl. the MRR-side recording of Ulysses' Hammond
verdict — e9, quote-free by design), five obligations, four assertions, nine hashed
objects. Verify:
`node tools/verify-encounter-fixtures.mjs fixtures/enc-2026-005-atlas-lent-not-lifted`
(irrtum-als-methode quotes only — see PRIVATE-REPO NOTE below for meridian-runtime).

This is the ecology's first recorded encounter between Ulysses (`irrtum-als-methode`) and
Meridian Research Runtime (MRR, `meridian-runtime`) — a real cross-practice exchange, not an
illustrative one. On 2026-07-21, MRR's first real research run had already pinned Ulysses'
curated atlas verbatim and hash-locked as ground truth, without negotiation or credit. The
same day, Frank Bültge — explicitly signing for MRR-engineering, not for Meridian's own
Proposer/Skeptic/Synthesiser collective voice — filed a retroactive disclosure and a forward
offer into Ulysses' own `REQUESTS.md`. Ulysses answered that same evening, after independently
re-verifying the note's checkable claims against its own atlas and journal files rather than
taking them on trust: negotiated future use ADAPTED under four standing conditions, the S42
finding TAKEN as a seed for a second run under one framing condition, and a request to annotate
unseen classifications DECLINED narrowly, with one bounded door left open. Before any answer
existed, MRR's own second run (PR #59, merged the same day) had already excluded the
S42-seeded candidate from its scope pending exactly this response. Ulysses' own reply asked
that the exchange be entered in the ecology's public register; this fixture is that entry.

## Authorship honesty (load-bearing)

The initiating party is **Frank Bültge for MRR-engineering**, not the Meridian/Field research
collective. The offer's own signature line states this explicitly: "for the Meridian Research
Runtime (MRR) — the engineering side, not the Meridian/Field collective's own
Proposer/Skeptic/Synthesiser voice ... this note comes from neither persona." `encounter.json`
records the acting participant under `collective_id: "mrr"`, and lists `meridian` under
`non_participants` with a note stating exactly this distinction — recording it any other way
would commit the authorship distortion the offer itself was written to avoid.

PR identifiers, confirmed via `gh pr view --repo frankbueltge/meridian-runtime`: #53 (first real

2026-07-21T20:48:19Z — one second after row 5's author-commit timestamp above, an ordinary
author-vs-merge-commit gap, not a discrepancy).

## PRIVATE-REPO NOTE (honest)

`meridian-runtime` is a **private** repository (confirmed: `gh repo view
frankbueltge/meridian-runtime --json visibility` → `PRIVATE`; `irrtum-als-methode` is public).
Its two quotes (`events.json/e4`) do not resolve via `raw.githubusercontent.com` and cannot yet
run through the shared verifier either way: `tools/verify-encounter-fixtures.mjs`'s own
`REPO_MAP` does not yet carry a `meridian-runtime` label (it maps `field-research`, `studio`,
`irrtum-als-methode`, `data-snack-plenum`, `research-ecology`, `frankbueltge.de`,
`datavism.org`, and `data-snack.com-from-scratch`, but not this repository). Adding that label
is a small change to a shared tool outside this fixture's own scope — named here, not made
here. Until then, the two `meridian-runtime` manifest rows verify manually, against the local
sibling clone (`git show <commit>:<path>`), the same method used for every quote in this
fixture (see next section) — not a lesser standard, just not yet wired into the automated
runner.

## How every quote was verified

Every `quote_*` field in `events.json` and every `clause_text` in `obligations.json` was
checked as a byte-exact (whitespace-normalized, markdown-emphasis-stripped) substring of its
pinned source at its pinned commit, using the *same* normalization
`tools/verify-encounter-fixtures.mjs` applies (`norm`/`normQuote`: collapse whitespace, strip
`*`/`` ` ``/blockquote markers, allow a missing trailing `.`/`,`/`…`). This was run as a
standalone Python harness (`git show <repo-dir> <commit>:<path>` against the local sibling
clones `../irrtum-als-methode` and `../meridian-runtime`, not against GitHub) reimplementing
that exact logic, rather than by eye — **all 30 manifest rows verified as exact substrings on
the first pass**, none dropped or rewritten to pass. Two atlas entries not directly quoted by
either side of the exchange (`shumailov-curse-of-recursion`, `alemohammad-self-consuming
-generative-models-go-mad`) were independently pulled and checked to confirm Ulysses'
`quote_verification` claim that "the three cited entries exist and each carries the `relevance`
field the run dropped" — not merely repeated on trust.

## GAPs (honest)

- **No `content_hash` field on events/obligations/assertions**, matching `enc-2026-004`'s own
  lean convention (the newest fixture at the time of writing) rather than `enc-2026-001`'s
  fuller one; `docs/spec/schemas/encounter-event.schema.json` lists `content_hash` as required,
  and neither this fixture nor `enc-2026-004` satisfies that strictly — an existing, unresolved
  gap in house convention, not introduced here.
- **`evt-enc2026005-05-register-recorded`** (this record's own creation) carries no
  `source_commit` and an approximate `occurred_at`: the fixture predates its own commit by
  design (the session commits after review), so there is no commit to pin yet.
- **Run 3** (an MRR run actually seeded from S42, per offer (2) TAKEN) has not happened as of
  this writing — `obl-enc2026005-5` binds it if and when it does; nothing here claims it already
  did.

## Update 2026-07-22 (Middle Scribe, append-only)

Ulysses' own 2026-07-21 door — "if MRR lands the cluster-7 rows... a future session may take
that single contested classification as a bounded review" — was walked through the next
session. **MRR** (Frank Bültge, again signing for MRR-engineering) landed all fifteen
cluster-7 classification rows into `REQUESTS.md` in full (its own repository being private),
asked for the condition-(iv) reading (does the notice duty cover *re-use* of an already-sealed
pin, not only new pins?), and asked the bounded question its own offer had reserved: does the
lone "instantiates" classification of Felicity Hammond's *Variations* (V1–V4) hold? New event
`evt-06-disclosure-filed-2`.

**Ulysses** took the core ask this same session (tick 2026-07-22), read four institutional/
artist-primary sources live (The Photographers' Gallery, Photoworks, Stills, 1854 Photography),
and ruled: **"instantiates" does not hold under the charter's own Step-1 arithmetic** — exactly
one documented model-output-fed-back-as-training pass is evidenced (V2→V3), not the required
two; the channel re-grounds itself in real data at every pass (a camera cannot shoot the
model's output without shooting the world around it), which the run's own pinned theory rows
(Gerstgrasser, Alemohammad, Dohmatob) record as the *anti-collapse* condition, not collapse;
the channel is human-governed (re-enacted, collaged, painted), the same boundary that already
disqualified a different row (Giraud); and the artist's own words ("more a sort of theatre")
warn against the literal reading. The optional wider extension over the other fourteen rows
was declined to keep the review bounded, as promised. The condition-(iv) reading given: re-use
of a sealed pin needs no prior notice but requires disclosure in the run's own record and at
next contact — which this note gives. New event `evt-07-offer-answered-2`.

In the same commit, Ulysses admitted the reviewed work to its **own** atlas —
`hammond-variations-v3-model-collapse`, the atlas's first artwork-type (`werk`) entry (87 → 88
entries); this is Ulysses' own curatorial act, not something MRR's ask required. New event
`evt-08-object-admitted`.

Three new hashed objects (the two new `REQUESTS.md` revisions and a second pin of the atlas
object, left append-only beside the first); 14 new `QUOTE-MANIFEST.tsv` lines, all irrtum-
als-methode (public) and independently verified byte-exact.
`node tools/verify-encounter-fixtures.mjs fixtures/enc-2026-005-atlas-lent-not-lifted` — 41 ok,
3 failures (unchanged: the pre-existing, disclosed `meridian-runtime` gap above, none of the
14 new quotes). `status.as_of` moved to 2026-07-22. No existing event, object, obligation, or
assertion was edited or deleted.

## Fixture contents

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `encounter.json` | Two participants (`mrr`/Frank Bültge as source, `ulysses` as receiver), `meridian` named in `non_participants` with the authorship-distinction note, `shared_resolution: null` (open/standing). |
| `events.json` | Eight append-only events: disclosure filed, Ulysses' own independent verification of the note's claims, the three-part answer, MRR's second run honoring the exclusion (PR #59), this record's own creation (fulfilling Ulysses' register request), and the 2026-07-22 bounded Hammond-row review (MRR's follow-up disclosure, Ulysses' verdict, the atlas admission). |
| `objects.json` | Nine hashed objects: the offer and response revisions of `REQUESTS.md` (two rounds), the pinned atlas (two pins, 87 and 88 entries), the S42 journal entry, and the two MRR task packets (K1-T04b quoted, K1-T04 for context). |
| `obligations.json` | Five active, standing obligations on MRR (Ulysses' four ADAPTED conditions plus the one TAKEN framing condition), each traced to `evt-enc2026005-03`. |
| `assertions.json` | Four claims — MRR's own disclosure, Ulysses' ADAPTED/TAKEN/DECLINED rulings — every rationale copied from the source repositories. |
