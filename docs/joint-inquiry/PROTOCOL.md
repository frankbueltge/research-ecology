<!-- Provenance: adopted 2026-07-19 by Frank Bültge from the Joint-Inquiry spec package
v0.1.0 (archived in frankbueltge.de docs/research-ecology-joint-inquiry-spec-v0.1.0/).
ADOPTED: this protocol (the concept and record layer) and the JSON schemas.
DEFERRED, deliberately (see docs/design/joint-inquiry-adoption-2026-07-19.md): the
package,s machine layer — coordinator, SQL persistence, local adapters, dedicated Middle
UI (task packets JI-03…JI-06). Rationale: ADR-0005 (read-only before writeable
federation) and the Meridian Research Runtime, whose specified federation layer (E5/E6:
Task Bundles + Node Task Decisions) IS the natural transport for inquiry dispatch once it
exists — the same machine must never be built twice. Until then, joint inquiries run
MANUALLY: the record lives as a ji-* fixture (see fixtures/ji-_template/), invitations
travel through the practices' own REQUESTS channels, moves are ordinary local projects,
the Middle Scribe transcribes. -->
# Joint Inquiry Protocol
## Temporary collaboration without a shared ontology

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** proposed shared protocol extension  
**Applies to:** Research Ecology shared layer and participating local practices

## 1. Purpose

A Joint Inquiry enables two or more sovereign practices to work temporarily on one concrete problem, material or situation without becoming one collective, adopting one method or assigning permanent roles.

The protocol exists because an isolated Encounter can document an exchange but does not by itself create enough temporal and procedural continuity for reciprocal research. A Joint Inquiry groups several encounters and local projects while keeping their authority local.

## 2. Constitutional invariants

Every implementation must preserve the following.

### 2.1 Voluntary participation

A practice may accept, accept with conditions, defer, decline, withdraw or remain silent according to its local protocol. Technical reachability never implies participation.

### 2.2 Local sovereignty

Each practice retains control of:

- its local research question;
- methods and media;
- internal workflow and model use;
- local project status;
- claims and caveats;
- publication and withdrawal;
- and interpretation of what the inquiry changed.

### 2.3 No fixed division of labour

A concrete inquiry may temporarily ask Meridian to measure, Ensemble to construct an experiential situation or Ulysses to produce an artistic counter-operation. These are project-specific commitments, not identities.

The shared layer must not encode permanent assumptions such as:

```text
Meridian = evidence supplier
Ensemble = design service
Ulysses = theoretical commentator
```

### 2.4 No shared epistemic authority

The Joint Inquiry may record operational facts: who joined, which local object was referenced, which event occurred and which resource limit applied.

It may not canonically decide:

- which participant had the correct interpretation;
- whether one work faithfully translated another;
- whether the inquiry produced an event or breakthrough;
- whether the collaboration succeeded artistically or scientifically;
- or whether a shared resolution exists.

Such statements remain authored assertions.

### 2.5 Encounters remain atomic exchange histories

A Joint Inquiry never replaces the Encounter protocol. Every transfer, challenge, correction, commission, response, refusal or translation between practices is still represented as an Encounter or encounter event.

The Joint Inquiry only supplies a correlation and coordination envelope.

### 2.6 No automatic synthesis

A Joint Inquiry may end with:

- one shared work;
- several incompatible local works;
- an instrument and a counter-work;
- a corrected claim;
- a refusal;
- a failed collaboration;
- an unresolved remainder;
- a local protocol change;
- or no publishable output.

No generated summary may erase participant differences.

### 2.7 Resource boundedness

Every accepted commitment declares a budget or operational bound. There is no unbounded autonomous loop.

The default profile allows one first move and one return move per practice. Extension requires explicit participant decisions and a new resource envelope.

### 2.8 Human accountability without daily control

Frank is not required to approve every local move or branch. Internal practices may accept and operate within their standing delegations.

Human review is required when the inquiry crosses a local escalation boundary, including publication, rights ambiguity, affected publics, sensitive data, material new cost, protected infrastructure or protocol amendment.

## 3. Necessary conditions for starting a Joint Inquiry

A proposal is valid only if it specifies:

1. **Concrete shared problem** — not only a theme such as truth, AI, difference or power.
2. **Shared material or source situation** — at least one versioned object, event, dataset, claim, rule, environment or documented situation.
3. **Reason for plurality** — why one practice alone is insufficient or why incompatibility is constitutive.
4. **Invited practices or open participation policy.**
5. **Initial coordination profile.**
6. **Resource envelope and termination condition.**
7. **Rights, affected-public and privacy assessment at the appropriate level.**
8. **No-publication default unless separately approved.**

A machine may propose an inquiry. It may not fabricate consent or accept on behalf of another practice.

## 4. Roles

Roles are open strings and local descriptions. The shared profile recognizes only procedural categories:

- `initiator`
- `participant`
- `invited`
- `observer`
- `affected_party`
- `coordinator_component`
- `curator`

These do not define epistemic function.

A practice may declare a project-local functional commitment such as `empirical challenge`, `material construction`, `artistic operation`, `counter-reading` or `field observation`. This text remains local and non-canonical.

## 5. Local commitment

Participation becomes active only when a practice publishes or signs a Local Commitment.

A Local Commitment contains:

- practice and accountable actor;
- local project reference or planned local project ID;
- local question;
- intended method, operation or mode;
- expected first move;
- inputs admitted from the shared inquiry;
- conditions and refusals;
- what could materially change its position;
- planned outputs as open strings;
- resource limits;
- maximum autonomous moves;
- return obligation, if accepted;
- escalation policy;
- local publication policy;
- and local status.

A commitment is not a promise of success. It is a bounded declaration of participation.

## 6. Coordination profiles

The protocol defines reusable procedural profiles. They are not research methods.

### 6.1 `parallel_return`

All participants receive the shared material and produce one local first move independently. After mutual exposure, each may make one return move.

Use when divergent practices should not be pre-aligned.

### 6.2 `relay`

One participant produces an object that becomes an offered input to another; the transformed result may return or pass onward.

Use when transformation through passage is the research object.

### 6.3 `cross_examination`

Participants explicitly challenge claims, methods, categories or forms produced by one another.

Use when falsification, contestation or apparatus critique is central.

### 6.4 `shared_fieldwork`

Participants share a collection or observation situation but keep separate local records and interpretations.

Use when a common event or environment is more important than common outputs.

### 6.5 `commission_with_return`

One practice commissions another under conditions, and the resulting object is returned for response or correction.

Use when a temporary asymmetry is explicit but must not become a service identity.

### 6.6 `custom`

A custom profile is allowed if the sequence, decision rights and resource bounds are declared.

## 7. Default lifecycle

```text
PROPOSED
-> FORMING
-> ACTIVE
-> REVIEW
-> DORMANT or ARCHIVED
```

Alternative terminal state:

```text
CANCELLED
```

### `PROPOSED`

A valid proposal exists. No participation is implied.

### `FORMING`

Invitations and local decisions are pending. At least one participant has not yet published an active commitment.

### `ACTIVE`

The minimum number of participants has accepted and all required commitments validate.

### `REVIEW`

The declared moves are complete or a stop condition has been reached. Each participant may publish a local position, archive, kill, continue locally or propose an extension.

### `DORMANT`

No current move is expected, but the inquiry remains reopenable.

### `ARCHIVED`

The operational history is preserved. No global semantic resolution is implied.

### `CANCELLED`

The proposal or active inquiry ended before completion because of withdrawal, rights, budget, invalid material, safety or lack of viable participation.

There is deliberately no canonical `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `RESOLVED` or `BREAKTHROUGH` state.

## 8. Participant-local lifecycle

Participant states are independent:

```text
INVITED
ACCEPTED
ACTIVE
WAITING
LOCAL_REVIEW
COMPLETED_LOCAL
DECLINED
WITHDRAWN
BLOCKED
```

A Joint Inquiry can be in `ACTIVE` while one participant is `WAITING`, another is `LOCAL_REVIEW` and another has `WITHDRAWN`.

## 9. Minimal move model

A `local move` is an operational report that one practice has advanced its local project in a way relevant to the inquiry.

It contains:

- local project reference;
- input object versions actually used;
- resulting local object references;
- claimed change, if any;
- limitations and caveats;
- whether another participant is asked to respond;
- resource usage summary;
- machine and human participation disclosure;
- and whether an escalation was triggered.

The shared system does not inspect the complete internal process unless the practice exposes it.

## 10. Extension

An inquiry does not continue merely because more work is possible.

An extension requires:

- a reason grounded in a new result, resistance, material or unresolved dependency;
- participant-specific acceptance;
- updated local commitments where needed;
- a new or remaining resource envelope;
- and an explicit next-move limit.

A coordinator may suggest an extension. It may not activate one unilaterally.

## 11. Withdrawal and refusal

Withdrawal is legitimate and does not invalidate prior events.

A participant may state:

- capacity exhausted;
- method no longer appropriate;
- output would be merely illustrative;
- evidence no longer supports the premise;
- rights or ethical conditions changed;
- collaboration predetermines the local question;
- resource ceiling reached;
- or no reason disclosed.

The inquiry may continue with remaining participants if the minimum and commitments still hold. Otherwise it becomes dormant or cancelled.

## 12. Publication

### 12.1 Local publication

Each practice decides whether its local object is published according to its own protocol.

### 12.2 Joint exposition

A Joint Inquiry exposition in The Middle requires:

- a valid public inquiry record;
- participant positions or explicit absence states;
- links to public local objects or declared private/unavailable states;
- a trace of relevant encounters;
- apparatus and resource disclosure at the agreed level;
- rights clearance for displayed material;
- and human editorial approval for the public surface.

### 12.3 No collective authorship by default

A Joint Inquiry does not automatically create one shared author. Authorship must be declared per object and per exposition component.

## 13. Success and evaluation

The shared system does not score a Joint Inquiry. Participants and external observers may publish assertions such as:

- the problem changed;
- a method was invalidated;
- a work became possible;
- a collaboration collapsed into role fixation;
- an empirical result corrected an artistic premise;
- an artwork exposed a hidden measurement condition;
- or nothing consequential changed.

These assertions remain attributed, evidenced and contestable.

## 14. Amendment

This protocol can be amended through a dated shared decision. Local practices do not need to adopt new optional event types immediately. Unknown valid types remain visible.
